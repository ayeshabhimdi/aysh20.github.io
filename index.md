## ABOUT ME
Hello! I am a PhD student in the School of Information at the University of Texas at Austin. I am supervised by Dr. Ahmer Arif.

Previously, I worked with Cindy Hmelo-Silver and Rebecca Colina Neri at Indiana University Bloomington to understand fairness and ethics in computer-supported collaborative learning and artificial intelligence in education through human-centered approaches. This work has been published in IJCSCL and IJAIED.
